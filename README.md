# React and GraphQL Application

This project is a simple web application built using React and GraphQL. It allows users to log in, view events, create events, and manage bookings. The application uses a MongoDB database for data storage, and the backend server runs on port 8000, while the frontend is hosted on port 3000.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can log in to the application securely.

- **View Events**: Once logged in, users can view a list of events with details such as title, date, price, and description.

- **Create Events**: Authenticated users can create new events by providing the necessary information.

- **Manage Bookings**: Although the logic for creating and canceling bookings exists on the backend, this feature is not yet updated in the frontend.
